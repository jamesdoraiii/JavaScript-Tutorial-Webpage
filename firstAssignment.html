      <h1>Lesson 1: Functions</h1>

      <p>
      A javascript function is basically a block of code which is designed to carry out a particular task. The awesome thing about writing functions is that you can write them so that they complete any task you could possibly think of and in exactly the way that you want them to. It is possible for functions to accept something called parameters. Paramaters are basically bits of information that are fed into the function which the function will then utilize while completing its task. One of the reasons one might write a function instead of just writing the task out into standard code would be that a function is reusable! It can be used as many times you want and fed as many parameters as you want which can save you a lot of time and effort while developing. Functions are an integral part of JS coding and if you would like to learn more click the adjascent image.

      <h1>Lesson 2: Objects</h1>

      <p>
        Objects are an incredibly useful element of JavaScript and an invaluable asset! An object in javascript is like a container of data. The data that fills this container is made up of key/value pairs which describe the object itself. A good example of an object would be a car. A car has specific attributes like horsepower, color, and engine displacement. These attributes would be the key values and details like "400hp", "red", "5.7 Litres" would be the values assosiated with those keys. This becomes useful when sorting through a large amount of objects as one can then write a function that would filter out all red cars, or all cars over 300 horsepower for example. Objects are an incredibly useful tool and if you would like to learn more click on the picture located in this section.

      <h1>Lesson 3: Arrays</h1>

      <p>Now that you know what an object is it is time to learn about Arrays! Interestingly enough objects are arrays but they are a little different and it is much easier to think of them in their own right. Like an object an array is a container of data. The special thing about an array is that it can be sorted through using numbers. So you could have an array called drinks filled with ["Coffee","Water","Soda","Beer"] and since it is an array you have the ability to use a statement like drinks[1] and receive "Water" as the output. You also gain the ability to use properties like .length to find out how many elements are in the array. If you would like to learn more about arrays click on the image in this section.
